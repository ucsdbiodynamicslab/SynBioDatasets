# SynBioDatasets
Curation of high-quality datasets (experimental and simulated) for genetic circuits exhibiting interesting nonlinear behaviors (multistability, limit cycles, etc...). Datasets and benchmarks will be used to develop and analyze system identification methods for nonlinear biosystems.
